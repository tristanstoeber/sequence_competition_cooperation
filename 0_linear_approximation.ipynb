    "We consider two different scenarios: Sequence $s^1$ in isolation and in competition with a strong sequence $s^0$.\n",

    "In this case, the minimal required synaptic strength is further increased by a summation term that scales linearly with the rate and assembly size of the competing sequence, $M^0 r_i^{E0}$.\n",
    "We exemplify this effect by setting $M^0 = 1000$ and $r_i^{E0} = 50$ Hz for all $i$ (Figure \\ref{fig:SeqComp_requiredFF_compOnly}).\n",
    "We conclude that competition with another sequence additionally increases the required minimal synaptic weight, making it even more difficult for sequences with small assemblies to successfully propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study both competition and interaction in combination, we consider the full system with all three sequences.\n",
    "We assume that during encoding, $s^1$ and $s^2$, but not $s^0$, have been co-activated, allowing them to develop positive interactions via excitatory Hebbian plasticity.\n",
    "As before, all assemblies send inhibition to each other, unless specifically potentiated as part of the sequence formation process.\n",
    " \n",
    "To explore the effect of these positive interactions between sequences, we define a competition scenario in which both $s^1$ and $s^2$ are considered \\textit{weak}, while $s^0$ is \\textit{strong}.\n",
    "Assembly sizes are set to $M^{0}= 1500$, $M^{1}=900$, $M^{2}=900$ and excitatory feed-forward weights between $s^1$ and $s^2$ are systematically varied.\n",
    "We illustrate that mutual excitatory interactions allow \\textit{weak} sequences to win over a \\textit{strong} sequence (Figure \\ref{fig:Interaction}).\n",
    "However, it does not help to increase excitation from one to another sequence only.\n",
    "This can be intuitively understood by considering the inhibitory baseline condition.\n",
    "Exciting a sequence that sends inhibition back will make sequence progression more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we show that assemblies may use another sequence to enable sequential reactivation, while not being sequentially connected themselves.\n",
    "We silence $s^0$, keep rates and sizes of assemblies in $s^1$ fixed, and solve for $g^{22}_{ff}$ under the constraint that $r^2_{i} \\geq r^2_{i-1}$.\n",
    "By choosing different values for the mutual excitatory interactions $g^{12}_{ff} = g^{21}_{ff}$, it becomes clear that for large enough assemblies the required feed-forward weight approaches zero (Fig. \\ref{fig:reqff_interact}).\n",
    "Thus, elements of $s^2$ reactivate sequentially, even without any sequential structure in their feed-forward projections.\n",
    "Interestingly, as follows from the equations, the piggy-backing mechanism does not work for very small assemblies as feed-forward weights still grow reciprocally."
